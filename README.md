# ot-column-ccs-sampling

Repository to store code for OT based Column-CCS sampling technique.

The aim of this project is to integrates Cross-Concentrated Sampling (CCS) for sparse computation of Wasserstein distance matrices and Iterative CUR Completion (ICURC) for low-rank matrix reconstruction. 

Objectives include developing a Python pipeline to 
- process point clouds from images (like MNIST),
- handling resolution variations,
- image to point-cloud conversion,
- develop an algorithm that integrates CCS and Wasserstein distance calculation,
- compute full and partial distance matrices,
- evaluate reconstruction time
- Compare Signal to Noise ratio vs Rank vs Sampling ratio
